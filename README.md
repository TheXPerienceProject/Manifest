Getting Started The XPerience Project
---------------
You must be running a 64-bit Linux distribution and must have installed some packages to build
The XPerience Project. Google recommends using [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) for
this and provides instructions for setting up the system (with Ubuntu-specific commands) on
[the Android Open Source Project website](https://source.android.com/source/initializing.html#setting-up-a-linux-build-environment).

To initialize your local repository using the XPerience CAF trees, use a command like this:

      $ mkdir XPe
      $ cd XPe
      $ repo init -u https://github.com/TheXPerienceProject/Manifest -b xpe-18.0
      $ sudo install /usr/bin/repo .repo/repo/repo
    
Then to sync up:

    repo sync --force-sync --no-tags -j$(nproc --all) --optimized-fetch --prune

## Building The XPerience Project for your device

### Build Environment

- Tested and Working on any version of Ubuntu - 20.04 20.10 21.04 23.04 cinnamon(64-bit)
- Tested and working on manjaro 
- Any other distribution based of the Ubuntu Distro such as Lubuntu, Xubuntu and etc.
- A Terminal window
- A Good specs of hardware like 16 GB of RAM (32GB recomended) and an Intel octacore or amd ryzen 12cores
- A storage unit of any kind (minimum 1 TB). It would be better to use SSD because is more fast during the compliation process
- Some dependencies that should be installed

### [Dependencies for Linux](https://github.com/TheXPerienceProject/Manifest/wiki/Dependencies-for-Linux) or [Dependencies for Mac](https://github.com/TheXPerienceProject/Manifest/wiki/Dependencies-for-Mac)

### Building The XPerience Project ROM for your device
- Preparing Required Binaries and Device Drivers
- Set CCache for Faster Building (Optional)
- Build phase

### Set CCache
 
      $ sudo apt-get install ccache
      $ export USE_CCACHE=1
      $ export CCACHE_DIR=~/.ccache
      $ ccache -M 50G

Congratulations,the sources are initialized! 
	  
#### To build The XPerience Project ROM
      
      $ . build/envsetup.sh
      $ lunch xperience_codename-userdebug
      $ make bacon -j$(nproc --all)
